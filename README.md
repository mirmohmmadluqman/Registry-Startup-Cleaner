- **Keep backups** until you're certain everything works correctly
- **Restart your computer** after making changes for them to take effect

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Access Denied" Error
**Solution**: Make sure you're running the script as Administrator

### Script Doesn't Remove Entries
**Solution**: Some entries may be protected by Windows. Check Event Viewer for details.

### Entry Reappears After Removal
**Solution**: The program may be re-adding itself. Check:
- Task Scheduler
- Program settings/preferences
- Consider uninstalling the program

## 📝 Example Use Case

**Problem**: MiniTool Partition Wizard opens automatically on startup with update notifications

**Solution**:
1. Run Registry Startup Cleaner as administrator
2. The script finds and removes the MiniTool entry from registry
3. Backups are saved to Desktop and Backups folder
4. Restart computer
5. MiniTool no longer opens on startup
